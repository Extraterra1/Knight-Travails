# Knight's Tour Problem Solver

This JavaScript code demonstrates a solution to the Knight's Tour problem using a breadth-first search algorithm. The Knight's Tour problem is a classic chess puzzle where the goal is to find a sequence of moves for a knight piece to visit every square on a chessboard exactly once.

## Code Description

The code defines a function called `knightMoves(start, end)` that takes the starting position and the target position on an 8x8 chessboard as input. The function uses a breadth-first search algorithm to find a sequence of moves that the knight piece must take to reach the target position. It also prints the number of moves required and the path the knight takes.

### Example Usage

```javascript
const path = knightMoves([3, 3], [4, 3]);
```

In the above example, the `knightMoves` function is called with the starting position `[3, 3]` and the target position `[4, 3]`. The function calculates the path the knight should take and prints the results.

## Implementation Details

- The code defines two arrays, `possibleMovesX` and `possibleMovesY`, to represent all possible moves that a knight can make.
- The `validMove` function is used to check if a move is within the boundaries of the chessboard (8x8) and if the square has not been visited before.
- A queue data structure is used to explore possible knight moves in a breadth-first search manner.
- The code also maintains a `board` to keep track of visited squares.

## Output

The code will print the following information once it finds a solution:

- The knight made it!
- The number of moves it took.
- The sequence of moves in the form of `[x, y]` coordinates.
